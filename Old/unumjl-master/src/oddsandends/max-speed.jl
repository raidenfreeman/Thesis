#results.  Int64 max() and min() functions are MUCH faster.  if/then vs. ternary
#has no speed advantage.  Almost certainly the JNZ() directive is making a
#difference, but it seems alwasy better to just use max() or min().  Strangely
#terary op is worse for unsigned ints than it is for signed ints.
