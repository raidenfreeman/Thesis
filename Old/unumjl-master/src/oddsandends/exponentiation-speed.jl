#results:  It is a good idea to give the JIT compiler some hints as to what
#you're about to do.  Using UInt16 is much better than using UInt64, bitshifting
#is WAY better than exponentiation.  When profiling, it's a good idea to run
#multiple times, because it seems julia caches its compiled results.
